# Day 2

2/25/2022

Today I did not learn much new, but instead strengthened what I had already known. I practiced a lot with creating various classes, creating multiple instances of those same classes, and then calling on those instances to do stuff (depending on what the classes were of course). I also strengthened my knowledge of initializing variables within classes, which was a topic I was not very comfortable in before. I do enjoy refreshing myself on topics that I have not used in a while as well as leaning new stuff along the way.
