# Day 1

Yesterday I worked on a personal project in Unreal Engine. I was working on a Full Body Estimation system for VR applications. For most of the day I worked on a rotation logic for the shoulders trying to prevent the gimbal lock that regular rotations have difficulties with. The main fix i figured out is to implement the inverse of the yaw into the roll. When doing this it causes the rotation not to flip at the poles and helps it rotate cleanly. I learned a lot about how rotations work in 3D space and now i am much more experienced in complex rotations, and will be prepared when I need to use them in the future. I am excited where my personal project is going to go in the future, but either way it turns out I have learned so much about Two and Three bone IKs, rotations, rotation vectors and most importantly how to make my code readable and simplified enough to replicate.
