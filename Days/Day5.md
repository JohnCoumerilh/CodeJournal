# Day 5

  Today we worked with the table view by displaying data from a dataset taken from data.gov. We were able to take data on most common baby names and present it in a much more pleasing format by showing the data in a table view with a filter for All/Girls/Boys and it displays hw many times a name has been used (from the years the data is from).
