The App Delegate is based on the functions the the application itself instead of the individual scenes. The scene delegate on the other hand is the functions of the application's scenes and how they load. The Scene Delegate has many functions labeled as WillDoSomething and DidDoSomething. Anything you put inside the WillDoSomething functions will be ran right before the action of the function, while the DidDoSomething functions will be ran after that "Something" is completed.
